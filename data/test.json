The amount of compensation payable to the dependants, namely, the claimants was ascertained as Rs.12,85,600/-. The learned Tribunal, however, has recorded the finding that there was “composite negligence” in respect of both the vehicles, namely, the Truck as well as the Maruti Car and hence apportioned the amount of compensation payable on 50-50 basis and as such directed payment of 50% of such amount of compensation to the claimants. Since there was a contract of insurance between the owner of the Truck and the Insurance Company, the said amount was directed to be paid by the insurance company. Hence the present appeals.",

Our attention has been drawn to the receipts from various sources including from the Indane Bottling Plant and Bongaigaon Bottling Plant of Indian Oil Corporation (Assam Oil Division) which shows that the respondent received a huge amount of Rs.33 lacs for the year ending 31st March, 2000. Respondent No.5 has taken into consideration the depreciation of the plant and machineries and on that basis, it appears to have calculated a net profit of Rs.1,20,000/-. It is submitted by learned counsel for the appellant that by this calculation the gross total income of respondent No.5 is shown to be well below the limit of Rs.2 lacs prescribed under the scheme.

According to him, both the deceased and the accused appellant were staying together in the same house and he was living separately at a distance of about 100 yards from their residence. While the accused was living with his wife and children, the deceased was a bachelor. It is his version that the incident had taken place at about 6:00 PM at the house of the accused. He was informed by his elder brother, Shri Sahroi Rajput, at about 9:00 PM that some one had killed his son Ram Nath Rajput and on receipt of that information, he went to the place of occurrence and found that Ram Nath was lying dead with 2 cut injuries — one on the neck and the other on the cheek. After informing the garden Manager, he lodged the ejahar, written by the village Gaonburah at his instance. In his deposition, he stated that he had met the accused in the garden hospital and on enquiries being made by him, the appellant had told him that he had committed the crime in the midst of quarrel and getting this information, he had handed over his son to the police. However, in his cross-examination, he admitted that he had not informed the Investigating Officer that the accused had confessed before him that he had committed the offence.",

She pleaded not guilty to the charge and claimed to be tried whereupon the trial court commenced the trial. The case of the respondent is that of total denial. On the conclusion of the trial, the trial court passed the impugned judgment of acquittal. Mrs. T. Yangi, the learned counsel for the petitioner, assails the findings of the trial court by contending, firstly, that though the petitioner has clearly established the fact that the cheques were signed and issued by the respondent for the discharge of her debt and liability to her, which were subsequently dishonoured by the Bank and the respondent refused to pay the amounts despite receipt of her pleader notice, the trial court has erroneously held that the respondent was not guilty of the offences charged against him. She further submits that the trial court also committed perversity in holding that the respondent filed the complaint petition on 3-3-2004 immediately after issuing the pleader’s notice on 2-3-2004 without waiting for the expiry of the statutory notice period of fifteen days inasmuch it is on record that the complaint petition was filed on 22-3-2004 i.e. seventeen days after the notice period as the notice was received by her on 5-3-2004. According to the learned counsel, the trial court has completely overlooked the fact that under Section 139 NI Act, there is presumption in favour of the holder of the cheque and the onus lies on the drawer of the cheque to rebut the same by adducing evidence, but the respondent, in the instant case, does not adduce any evidence and does not, therefore, discharge the onus of proving that the cheques were not issued for discharging her debt to the petitioner. It is also the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate has failed to appreciate that no prudent person like the respondent would issue a cheque unless she had a liability to discharge and has in the process reached a wrong conclusion. She, therefore, strenuously urges this Court to reverse the findings of the trial court and return a verdict of guilty against the respondent.",

      "context": "The controversy arose on the following facts and circumstances pleaded by the appellant. The appellant, who is the wife, and the respondent were married according to Hindu rites and rituals, which was solemnised on 4-8-2000 at Shillong. Prior to their marriage also, they were known to each other as they worked together as Development Officers under the Life Insurance Corporation of India Ltd. since 1992. Thus, according to the appellant, their marriage was a love marriage. Though the respondent knew the nature of her duty and responsibility in their office even before their marriage, he and his family members, after their marriage, started demanding her to confine herself at home as a housewife and give up her job at the instigation of her father-in-law, who was then alive and had expressed his dislike for a working woman as a daughter-in-law. The respondent and his family members also ignored the fact that she had to look after and extend financial assistance to her old and ailing mother, her brother and other dependants for which he had promised not to interfere. They then slowly started to ill-treat her and ultimately created a situation, which, when it became unbearable, compelled her to leave her matrimonial home. The respondent taking advantage of this immediately instituted Divorce Suit No. 6(T) of 2003 before the learned Additional Deputy Commissioner (Judicial), Shillong for dissolution of their marriage under Section 13(1)(i-b) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (“the Act”). The suit was, however, dismissed by the learned Additional Deputy commissioner (J), Shillong as premature but he preferred RFA No. 9(SH) of 2006 before this Court, but the same was withdrawn by him with a liberty to file a fresh suit. This is how the instant suit was filed by him.",

The contentions of the State-respondents are that Section 113 of the Motor Vehicles Act empowers the State Government to impose restriction on the laden weight of vehicles to be driven on public roads, and of late the issue about over-loading of vehicles, especially trucks, has frequently come up from time to time in the public domain and has, therefore, engaged the attention of the State Government. The matter has even gone up to the Apex Court by way of some writ petitions. The attempt made by the State Government hitherto to check and control the overloading of trucks has not been very successful due to the multitude of trucks plying on the highways every hour of every day and shortage of manpower to carry out regular checking of the trucks. It has been realized by the State Government that control of overloading trucks cannot be effectively made so long as the trucks are allowed to have large bodies with huge loading space which enables truckers to overload their trucks. If such trucks have smaller bodies with lesser loading space, then the problem of overloading can eliminated. This prompted the State-respondents to restrict the size of the bodies of the trucks so as to ensure that the trucks carry their loads within the permissible limit of 9 metric (?) tons. This is how the impugned notification came to be issued.",

On the own showing of the petitioner that the Provincial Government of Assam had stopped payment of the royalty to him since 1952, there is no room for doubt that the petitioner has waived his right to claim the royalty in question or has acquiesced in to the deprivation of his right to claim the royalty by the State respondents by long passage of time. That apart, there is no satisfactory explanation for the delay spanning over six decades in filing the writ petition. Repeated representations, it is trite, does not and cannot extend the cause of action.

According to them, though the petitioner meets most of the criteria laid down therein, he did not fulfill criteria © of Clause 4, which stipulates that out of the last five Annual Confidential Reports, the two reports must be from Bn/ARTC&S/NSG. It is also the case of the answering respondents that one of the essential qualifications for promotion to the rank of Subedar Major is passing Army Certificate of Education-One or matriculation examination from a recognized Board of School Education. According to the answering respondents, in the year 1989, the petitioner produced a Certificate of High School Leaving Certificate Examination along with the mark sheet from the Central Board of Higher Education, Uttam Nagar, New Delhi-110059, which, on verification from the Central Board of Secondary Education vide their letter dated 10-2-2006, was found to be issued by a fake Board.

The fact that the rules for implementing the provisions of the Act have not been framed is an entirely different proposition and cannot be a ground for denial of pension altogether.

      "context": "Notwithstanding the aforesaid evidence, it is further averred by the petitioner, the respondent No. 4 is bent upon taking over the village of the petitioner by falsely claiming it to be a locality within the village of Huroi village. To achieve this illegal object, various complaints have been lodged by him before the authorities and the court of law. The dispute as to whether the petitioner village is a separate and independent village or whether this village is a locality of the respondent No. 4 was placed before the respondent No. 3 for adjudication. However, as the petitioner had apprehended that the respondent No. 3 was bias, he by his letter dated 12-4-2003 approached the District Council to ventilate his grievance but to no effect. In the meantime, the respondent 3, as apprehended by him, without hearing him, passed the order dated 15-7-2003 declaring his village as a locality within the jurisdiction of the respondent No. 4. This prompted the petitioner to prefer political appeal before the District Council on 22-7-2003, but when no action was taken even after the lapse of over a year, he approached this Court in WP (C) No. 219(SH) of 2005. This Court by the order dated 16-7-2004 disposed of the writ petition by directing the District Council to hear and decide the representation of the petitioner within a period of two months from the date of receipt of the representation. The petitioner thereafter filed the appeal accompanied by the copy of the said order before the respondent No. 3. The District Council, after sleeping over the matter and on the pain of facing contempt proceeding, finally directed the petitioner to appear before them on 14-6-2005 but without allowing him to represent his case: he was, instead, threatened, abused and insulted for having approached this Court and for filing contempt petition against them. This was followed by the impugned order purportedly on the basis of the hearing conducted by them on 14-6-2004 without giving him an opportunity of hearing or to adduce his evidence. Contending that the impugned order is mala fide, illegal, arbitrary and perverse and also betrays non-application of mind, this writ petition has been filed by him.",

In his statement recorded on 19-8-2001 he says that Sylvina Orang was a witch in the tea garden and that she was responsible for the death of his father and his elder brother through witchcraft. He also says that Sylvina Orang had caused his niece to go mad. He says that on 14-8-2001 he went to her house and called her to see his niece. Sylvina Orang came with him and was preceding him when he struck her with firewood and trampled her in the neck as a result of which she died.

On the same day, the respondent No. 5 along with the inhabitants of the village gave their approval to the election of the petitioner and authorized him to take charge and start working as the Headman in accordance with the custom prevailing in the Elaka. The decision was thereafter sent to the District Council (respondent 1) on 17-1-2010 for approval/recognition/confirmation. In the meantime, a dispute was raised by some clan concerning the said election of the petitioner from Ryngksai clan as the Head in the Durbar, which resulted in their filing representation by them to the Administrative Officer of the District Council for allowing them to elect their own Headman in accordance with the custom prevailing in the Elaka since time immemorial.

Munuswamy Mudaliar and anr., 1988 (Supps) SCC 651 submits that when Professor Sengupta filed the affidavit-in-opposition on behalf of the Institute defending the impugned action/inaction of the Director of the Institute, there is reasonable apprehension in the mind of the petitioner that she (Professor Sengupta) will have a predisposition to decide in favour of her superior authority and against the petitioner. I have given my anxious consideration to this submission of the learned counsel. The test for adjudging bias, plainly stated, is real likelihood of bias or a predisposition to decide for or against one party, without proper regard to the true merits of the dispute. However, vague suspicions of whimsical, desperate or paranoid and insecure people should not be made the standard to regulate normal human conduct. In the instant case, as already noticed, the apprehension of bias is expressed by the petitioner belatedly knowing fully well that Professor Sengupta has already been associated with the Committee for quite sometime. Therefore, the apprehension of bias entertained/expressed by her is fanciful, unreasonable and is more apparent than real.",

He was, however, placed under suspension w.e.f. 7-4-2005 under Rule 6(a) of the Assam Services Discipline and Appeal Rule, 1964 vide the Office Order dated 19-4-2005. A departmental enquiry was thereafter launched against him and on completion of the enquiry, he was reinstated to his service by resuming his duty on 14-10-2008. When no salary was released to him for sometime, he submitted his representation dated 20-1-2009 to the respondent No. 2 requesting him to release his pending salaries along with other service benefits admissible under the rule. After repeated reminders, the respondent No. 2 by his order dated 25-2-2009 allowed him to draw his pay and other allowances as admissible under the rules w.e.f. 14-10-2008.

According to him, being the seniormost teacher in the school, he was allowed to continue as in-charge Headmaster after the death of the earlier incumbent in GC MV School.

However, without taking into consideration his original date of appointment, his name was wrongly placed at serial No 46 in the final gradation list dated 10.6.08. It was also the contention of the appellant in the writ petition that the senior teachers of the school had submitted their 'No Objection Certificate' for allowing the appellant to continue as the Headmaster of the school.

According to the petitioner, she and her husband constructed one Assam Type house covered with tin-roof at Lumjarain Suchen village, Khlieriat P.S. Jaintia Hills District in the year 2005. The Corporation supplied electricity connection to their house, for which they regularly paid the bills. There is a public road between the Electric pole and their house, but the Corporation, instead of making straight connection from the said pole, had made the connection of live wire transmission over the CI sheet/tin roof of their house. It is alleged by the petitioner that on 7-6-2010 at about 12 PM, the live wire got snapped from the post and fell over and touched the CI sheet/tin roof of their house and that when her husband, aged about 50 years, without knowing this, took their minor-daughter, aged about two and half years old to the outside toilet to attend to call of nature, they came into contact with the said live wire and met an instantaneous death by electrocution.",

According to the prosecution, on 22-3-2008, a specific information received to the effect that one Tata truck LP (1612) bearing registration number WB-03-9587 ('the truck')loaded with consignment of ganja concealed under trade goods was on its way to Kolkata via Shillong. This prompted the officials of the Custom Department to keep constant surveillance of the truck on 23-3-2008 along NH-44 and at about 16:30 hours, they intercepted the truck near Mawryngkneng, East Khasi Hills District, Meghalaya. There were three persons on board in the truck. On query, they came to learn from the driver that other persons who were on board were the owner of the truck and the helper of the truck respectively. While scrutinising the document as produced by the driver, the helper of the truck managed to escape from the site in the forested area near the highway under cover of darkness. A massive manhunt was accordingly launched in that forested area, but the helper could not be traced out. Both the truck owner along with the driver were then brought to the Customs Headquarters at Shillong under escort together with the truck and the loaded goods for detailed search, examination and for completing other formalities. On reaching the Customs Headquarters at Shillong at around 8.30 P.M., two independent witnesses were called to witness the search of the truck. The driver of the truck then, in the presence of the truck owner and the independent witnesses, identified and pointed out the exact place where the contraband packages of ganja were concealed beneath the miscellaneous trade goods (scraps).",

However, CW-1 subsequently, clarified that inadvertently, the date 29.6.2000 was mentioned in the injury report instead of 29.7.2000. I am also of the view that the plea of false case on the basis of previous injury must have been raised because the prosecution witnesses had admitted about an earlier case filed by the second injured Jadab.

He had served the Indian Army as an Emergency Commissioned Officer from 1964 to 1969, whereafter, he was released from his service in the Army. He was appointed as an Assistant in the Corporation on 17.3.1970 in the scale of Rs.249 - 500/- p.m. At the time of release from the Army, the petitioner was drawing pay and allowance totalling Rs.860/- p.m. as per the Last Pay Certificate. The Corporation had issued a circular dated 2.6.1989 framing revised instructions regarding the methodology and manner of fixation of pay of Ex-servicemen consequent upon their re-employment in the Corporation. As per the said circular, the last pay drawn by the Ex-servicemen in the Army was to be protected in the employment in the Corporation. When option was called for from the Ex-servicemen, the petitioner exercised his option to have his salary re-fixed as per pay fixation formula contained in the circular dated 2.6.1989. According to the petitioner, since his pay in the Corporation was lower than the last pay drawn in the Army, as per the afore mentioned circular, the incremental difference that would emerge on such fitment should be added to his basic pay as on date of re-employment and that arrears were required to be released accordingly effective from 1.1.1988. Petitioner contends that the authorities in the Corporation had worked out a formula as per the aforementioned circular vide departmental communication dated 14.11.1990 and had fixed his salary at Rs.4366/- thereby conferring a financial benefit of Rs.1880/- over the pay drawn by him effective from 1.1.1988. He, therefore, claims pay protection of Rs.1880/- p.m. w.e.f. 1.1.1988. His claim was, however, rejected by the Corporation by order dated 22.3.1991.",

As electricity was required to operate the industrial unit, the petitioner approached the Respondent No.3 for providing electricity connection to his industrial unit. No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Corporation was also obtained and submitted. As electricity connection was not provided to the petitioner despite lapse of considerable time, the petitioner approached the Respondent No.3 to enquire about the matter. At this stage, the petitioner was furnished with a bill dated 13.11.2003 for an amount of Rs.21,613.86 issued by the Respondent No.3 to one M/s Leatheran, which was the previous occupier of the shed. The petitioner was informed that he had to first clear the aforesaid amount and then only the power supply would be provided to him. When the petitioner approached the higher authority complaining that providing electricity connection to his industrial unit could not be made contingent on payment of arrear dues of others, the respondents refused to provide electricity connection to the petitioner by making it clear that for providing electricity connection the petitioner had to first clear the outstanding liability.

The shares were purchased on 21.4.2000 for Rs.19,536/- and sold on 2.5.2001 for Rs.6,36,640/ i.e. on the increased price of more than 30 times in one year. The Commissioner of Income Tax (CIT) held the order to be erroneous and prejudicial to the interest of revenue and exercised suo motu revisional jurisdiction under Section 263 of the Act. It was, inter alia, observed that while accepting genuineness of the share transaction, the AO failed to make any enquiry which, in the facts and circumstances, would normally be made to ascertain the capital gain in question. The assessee was not a habitual operator of share market and had no share of any other company; share was not of a well known company; the price jumped from Rs.6 per share to Rs.200/- per share within a short span of thirteen months without any apparent reason. The AO could have obtained annual accounts of the company to satisfy himself whether the commercial activities of the company justified such a jump in price. He could have obtained price quotations of the shares on few dates to examine reasonableness of the jump. The alleged sellers and buyers should have been examined. Accordingly, the order was held to be erroneous and prejudicial to the interest of the Revenue. The AO was directed to re-frame the assessment after conducting necessary enquiries.",

It is worth mentioning that Co. Petition No.17 of 2001 (disposed of) was filed by the promoters of the Company (in liquidation) for winding up of the said Company on the ground that though the Company was incorporated in the year 1992, no shares was subscribed and no statutory meeting of the Company has held. The Statutory returns were also not submitted by the Company to the jurisdictional Registrar of Companies. In sum and substance, the Company never commenced its business after its incorporation. In view of such position, the Company Judge was pleased to hold that hardly any useful purpose will be served to allow the Company to remain alive on record. Therefore, it was ordered to wind up the Company and the Registrar of Companies/ Official Liquidator was directed, to initiate necessary action in accordance with law.",

The writ petitioner firm being ‘A’ category lease holder in the N.F.

The tenders were also opened on the same day in the office of the respondent No.5, but the respondent No.5 after opening did not prepare any comparative statement (CS). However, from the office of the respondent No.5 the writ petitioner firm gathered the information that his bid to the extent of Rs.3,12,012/- was found to be the highest in the process.

The petitioner’s firm requested for disclosure of information why the tender was discharged so unceremoniously when the petitioner’s firm was found to be the highest bidder.

Accordingly a request was made by the said letter to re-fix the pay of the petitioner at the stage of Rs. 670/- with further request to recover the over payment made due to wrong fixation of pay.",

Although the learned counsel for the petitioner by referring to ABITA Circular No. LDG. 59 dated 14.09.56 argued that the staff members are excluded from the definition of labourers, but the same cannot by itself lead to the interference that the expression 'workers' would not take into its fold both the categories, i.e. workmen and staff members in reference to the particular incident which resulted in the lock out.

Section 9 of the Foreigners Act, 1946 envisages the said provision which has been elaborately discussed by the Apex Court in the case of Sarbananda Sonowal (I) reported in AIR 2005 SC 2920.",

It is the case of the petitioners that there was absolutely no material towards formation of the subjective satisfaction as required in passing an order of detention under Section 3 of the NSA. Another ground urged is that the representation made by the detenu having not been disposed of by the respondent No.1 i.e. the Government of Manipur, on that ground alone, the impugned order of detention is liable to be interfered with. In this connection, the learned counsel for the petitioner has referred to the statement made in paragraph 17 of the writ petition,",

According to the respondent No. 1, this oil mill is located in a residential area and started its operation from 10 AM till late night causing inconvenience to him and other inhabitants of the area. This prompted the respondent No. 1 to file a petition before the Executive Magistrate, who, on 25-11-2005, forwarded it to the Officer-in-Charge, Sarbhog Police Station for conducting an inquiry and report, but no action was taken by the police. The respondent No. 1, therefore, informed the Additional Deputy Superintendent of Supplies to take action in this regard since the matter is under the Department of Civil Supplies, but when no action was taken, he approached the District Magistrate, Barpeta to initiate against the petitioner U/s 133 CrPC. Accordingly, a case being No. 27/2006 U/s 133 CrPC was registered. The petitioner contested the case and denied the allegations of the respondent No. 1. The petitioner contended in his written statement that the mill in question was established in his own land, which was not in a residential area, but is in a purely commercial area abutting NH-31 where heavy vehicles ply day and night thereby causing noise in larger volume than that of the noise produced by the sound of his oil mill.",

Accused No.2 in turn engaged accused Nos.3 and 4, Jabed Ali and Ali Akbar, to cause the murder.

On the fateful night, Anita was sleeping in the same bed with Smt. Gita Das and her minor daughter. Husband of Smt. Gita Das, Shri Prabir Das, had gone to the residence of Shri Ajay Chakraborty to guard the house during night time in the absence of Shri Ajay Chakraborty. At around midnight, one miscreant entered into the house of Smt. Gita Das by digging a small tunnel whereafter he opened the door. Hearing the noise, Smt. Gita Das woke up and saw one person inside the room. She tried to wake her sister Anita. In the meanwhile, another person entered into the room and came near the bed where they were sleeping. With the help of torchlight, they identified Anita whereafter they dealt repeated dagger blows on the person of Anita. They dragged her to the floor and continued to deal dagger blows on her. When Smt. Gita Das tried to raise hue and cry, the two miscreants threatened her in Bengali language to remain silent. After she died, the two miscreants left the room.",
